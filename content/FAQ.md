A: There are no restrictions on the type or size of the models. Participants are free to use any open-source, pre-trained model.

**3. Q: Are there restrictions on the tools used for audio synthesis? Specifically, are we required to use only open-source TTS models and prohibited from using commercial APIs like Doubao?**

A: Yes, that is correct. Audio synthesis must be performed using open-source TTS models only. The use of commercial APIs is not permitted.

**4. Q: For Track 1, is a purely cascaded structure (ASR + LLM + TTS) allowed?**

A: No, it is not allowed. You can only use a "thinker-talker" structure or an end-to-end structure.
