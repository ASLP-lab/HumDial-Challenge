## Challenge Call 

Recent breakthroughs in large foundation models and speech technology have propelled spoken dialogue systems toward more natural and expressive interactions. However, evaluating the true “human-likeness” of these systems remains an open challenge, as existing benchmarks often fall short in capturing emotional intelligence and real-time conversational dynamics. The 2026 HumDial Challenge (Human-like Spoken Dialogue Systems Challenge) addresses this critical gap by introducing two focused tracks: Emotional Intelligence and Full-Duplex Interaction. Participants will tackle rich, multi-turn dialogues that demand nuanced emotional reasoning, dynamic empathy, and real-time coordination. With comprehensive evaluation frameworks and human-annotated real-recording datasets, the challenge aims to establish a new standard for assessing human-like dialogue capabilities, driving the next generation of emotionally aware, fluidly interactive AI agents.
