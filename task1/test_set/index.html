<h2 id="evaluation--ranking-mechanism">Evaluation &amp; Ranking Mechanism</h2>
<p>The evaluation methodology is specifically designed for the distinct characteristics of each task. For <strong>Task 1 and Task 2</strong>, the evaluation will be conducted primarily through <strong>Large Language Model (LLM) Automated Scoring</strong> to ensure objectivity and efficiency. <strong>Task 3</strong>, on the other hand, focuses on assessing the comprehensive performance of speech emotion interaction, and will therefore combine preliminary LLM scoring with in-depth <strong>Human Evaluation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1 &amp; 2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LLM Automated Scoring</strong>: This stage involves a comprehensive preliminary evaluation of all submissions. We will leverage a Large Language Model to perform an efficient, quantitative analysis of the model outputs. This analysis will serve as the basis for the initial ranking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Task 3</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LLM Automated Scoring</strong>:  As with Task 1 &amp; 2, all submissions for Task 3 will first undergo the same LLM Automated Scoring process described above.</li>
<li><strong>Human Scoring</strong>: For the top-performing teams identified in the LLM scoring stage, we will invite professionally trained evaluators to conduct an in-depth assessment. This stage is designed to complement the LLM evaluation, with a particular focus on assessing the speech-related dimensions.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation Process</strong>:
<ol>
<li>All submissions will first undergo <strong>LLM Automated Scoring</strong>.</li>
<li>We will select the <strong>top-ranked teams</strong> from this stage to advance to the next round.</li>
<li>The submissions from the shortlisted teams will then be scored by human evaluators.</li>
<li>Once the final rankings are determined, we will only announce the results of the top-ranked teams.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The final ranking for this challenge track is determined by a final score that reflects the comprehensive performance across all three tasks. This score is calculated as a weighted sum of LLM (Large Language Model) Automated Scoring and <strong>Human Scoring</strong> to ensure a comprehensive and authoritative assessment.<br>
To ensure a fair and scientifically rigorous evaluation, the final scoring weights will be dynamically determined. This process will take into account various factors, including the overall performance distribution of all participating models. Therefore, the final weights will be officially announced only after all submissions have been received and the unified evaluation is complete.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detailed Scoring Rules</strong>:
For more detailed evaluation dimensions and scoring criteria, please refer to our official guidance document on <a href="https://github.com/ASLP-lab/Hum-Dial/tree/main/Emotional_Intelligence">GitHub</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Submission Method</strong>:<br>
All submissions must be made through <a href="https://forms.gle/QrCWdQKvVQMzmXHz5">official Google Form</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submission File and Version Control</strong>:<br>
Teams are required to package all submission materials into a single compressed file named HD-Track1.zip and upload it to their Google Drive. In the official submission form, teams should provide a publicly accessible download link for this ZIP file.<br>
Teams must ensure that the link&rsquo;s sharing permission is set to &ldquo;Anyone with the link can view&rdquo; to prevent submission failure due to access issues. Each team may submit a maximum of three times via the Google Form before the deadline. To update their submission, teams can submit a new form with an updated link.<br>
The <strong>latest link</strong> a team submits in the Google Form before the deadline (November 24, 2025, 23:59，AoE) will be considered their official entry. After the deadline, we will download and archive the file from that link a single time. This downloaded version will be considered their final and sole submission. Any modifications made to the file on Google Drive after the deadline will not be considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Submission Checklist</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>jsonl Files</strong>:
<ul>
<li>For each task, you must submit a corresponding result file in .jsonl format.</li>
<li>File Structure Example: <a href="https://github.com/ASLP-lab/Hum-Dial/blob/main/Emotional_Intelligence/submit/HD-Track1-T1%262.jsonl">HD-Track1-1&amp;2.jsonl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ASLP-lab/Hum-Dial/blob/main/Emotional_Intelligence/submit/HD-Track1-T3.jsonl">HD-Track1-3.jsonl</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Audio Files (Required for Task 3 only)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If you are participating in <strong>Task 3</strong>, you must submit the audio files generated by your model.</li>
<li>The audio files within the ZIP package must strictly follow the naming convention: <strong>{dialogue_id}_{turn_id}_response.wav</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>System Description Document</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Each team must submit a system description document in PDF format. The document must be <strong>at least 2 pages in length</strong>, including references.</li>
<li>The document should outline your <strong>methodology, data construction, model architecture, training strategy</strong>, and other relevant implementation details.</li>
<li>The document must adhere to the official ICASSP 2026 paper template, available here: <a href="https://cmsworkshops.com/ICASSP2026/papers/paper_kit.php#Templates">ICASSP 2026 Paper Kit</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Important: Both the jsonl files and the system description document are mandatory. Failure to submit either of these components will result in disqualification.</p>
